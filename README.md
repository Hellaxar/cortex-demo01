# cortex-demo01

This is a skeleton project intended for use in a class when teaching the baisc first steps of building a cortex based PROS code project.  Students should clone this project to their local PROS environment, and use it to understand the basic interaction between the driver control (opcontrol.c) and autonomous (auto.c) compenents of a typical VRC tournament.
